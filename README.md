RAG Implementation with LlamaIndex Google Gemini
Overview
The RAG Implementation with LlamaIndex Google Gemini project utilizes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques for extracting data from PDF documents. This project leverages Google Gemini, a library for working with PDF documents, to implement the RAG methodology effectively.

What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a framework that combines the strengths of information retrieval (retrieval) and natural language generation (generation) techniques. In this project, RAG is used to extract relevant information from PDF documents by first retrieving relevant passages and then generating concise summaries or structured data from these passages.

Why LlamaIndex?
LlamaIndex is a specialized indexing technique designed to efficiently handle large volumes of text data, such as those found in PDF documents. By utilizing LlamaIndex, this project optimizes the retrieval process, enabling faster and more accurate extraction of information from PDF files.

Google Gemini
Google Gemini is a powerful library developed by Google for parsing and working with PDF documents. By integrating Google Gemini into this project, we benefit from its robust features and functionality, making it easier to extract data from PDF files in conjunction with the RAG methodology.

Usage
To utilize this project, simply follow the installation instructions and run the provided scripts. Detailed usage instructions and examples are available in the project documentation.
